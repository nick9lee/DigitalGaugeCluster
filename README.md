# DigitalGaugeCluster
Engg 233 Final project

Built with Amrit M

Digital gauge cluster.
simulates what driver would see using data from csv file

to run, open project in Processing and click run on FinalProject233.pde

need to install this library in processing to run on your computer (gicentreUtils 3.4.0). this can be done by Sketch>libraries then cpy paste i the search bar

depending on your resolution it might look a bit different than in the image. I made this like 2.5 years ago now, so i can't tell if I made this specifically for my machine or if I downloaded the wrong library. Ill try and figure it out
